## Key Projects

#### Baseball Regression Analysis 
* Created a multiple linear regression model and trained it based on self created data
* Used the model to make predictions on the testing data and performance analysis 
* Ran hypothesis tests to make conlusions on the data findings

**Libraries**: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `scikit`

#### Cancer Regression Analysis 
* Created a binary logistic regression model and trained it based on the data from the datatset
* Used the model to make predictions on the testing data and performance analysis 
* Provided a classification report analysis of the model performance

**Libraries**: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `scikit`
